# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Document-Clustering

-To find similarities between documents, we analyze the frequency of text and its coordinates.

-If a combination of text and coordinates appears frequently across documents, it suggests shared patterns.

-Conversely, if a combination of text and coordinates appears only once, it's unique to that document.

-Cleaning up unique occurrences helps focus on patterns common across multiple documents.
